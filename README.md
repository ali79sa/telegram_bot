# telegram_bot
A Telegram bot source code

This is the source code of a Telegram bot that gets orders from users and sends them to the admin for acceptance and publishes them on a Telegram channel.
Users can remove their order from the channel whenever they want (by clicking on a button that the bot sends to them).
The bot gets the orderâ€™s information step by step from the user.
Admin can reject or accept the orders.
Check the code for more.
There is a sql_creator.py file that creates the database file so you have to run it once at first.
